## Objective

Understand the difference between RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings.

## Introduction

In Kubernetes, RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings are critical for linking roles with users, groups, or service accounts, granting them the necessary permissions to perform actions within the cluster.

## RoleBinding

A RoleBinding grants permissions defined in a Role or ClusterRole within the confines of a specific namespace. This means that even if a ClusterRole is referenced by a RoleBinding, it only applies within that particular namespace.

## ClusterRoleBinding

In contrast, a ClusterRoleBinding applies a ClusterRole across all namespaces within the cluster, including cluster-scoped resources. This broad application makes ClusterRoleBindings crucial for administrative tasks that span multiple namespaces.

## Key Differences and Usage

- Scope:
  - RoleBinding: Limited to a single namespace.
  - ClusterRoleBinding: Applies across all namespaces.

- Usage:
  - RoleBinding: Often used when the permissions need to be namespace-specific.
  - ClusterRoleBinding: Used when permissions need to be cluster-wide, such as for system administrators or certain automated tasks.

- Flexibility and Policy Management:
  - Reusability: ClusterRoles are reusable across multiple namespaces with just additional RoleBindings, avoiding duplication.
  - Policy Management: ClusterRoles allow for centralized role definitions, simplifying the management and enforcement of policies across multiple namespaces.

## Common Practices

- ClusterRole with RoleBinding: Useful for applying a set of permissions uniformly across multiple namespaces without granting cluster-wide access. This approach adheres to the principle of least privilege by restricting access to resources within specific namespaces.

- ClusterRole with ClusterRoleBinding: Typically used for roles that require broad access across the entire cluster, which is common in roles designed for cluster administrators or core system components.

## Example

Below is an example of how to create a ClusterRole and bind it with a RoleBinding to apply it to a specific namespace:

```
kubectl create namespace my-namespace
# Create a ClusterRole
kubectl create clusterrole pod-reader --verb=get,list --resource=pods

# Bind the ClusterRole within a specific namespace
kubectl create rolebinding pod-reader-binding --clusterrole=pod-reader --serviceaccount=default:my-service-account --namespace=my-namespace
```

This setup allows the service account in 'my-namespace' to read pods in that namespace using permissions defined in a ClusterRole, demonstrating the flexibility and power of combining ClusterRoles with RoleBindings for fine-grained access control within specific areas of your cluster.
